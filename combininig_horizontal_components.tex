\section{Combining Horizontal Components}
Downhole and surface data comparison is the best method to understand the behavior of the soil column during the strong motion. However, in some cases the instruments are not aligned. In order to minimize the effects of unknown rotation we need to combine the horizontal components. We can merge the horizontal components in time and frequency domain.\\

\subsection{Time Domain}

Combination of two horizontal motion in time domain is called "Complex Representation of Horizontal Motion". In order to construct an accurate representation of the horizontal motion \citet{Steidl1996} treated the horizontal time histories as two-dimensional signal by forming a complex time series: 
\begin{equation}
A_H(t) = A_X(t) + iA_Y(t),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
[A_X(t),A_Y(t),A_Z(t)]
\end{equation}

represent, the two horizontal $(X,Y)$ and the vertical $(Z)$ components of the accelerogram. {\color{red} see the details.}.

\subsection{Frequency Domain}

Combining the horizontal components in the frequency domain could be done thorough the amplitude of Fourier transform or Spectral acceleration.  Here are the different methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item geometric mean (PSA, \citet{Kaklamanos2013}) 
\item
\item
\end{itemize}
