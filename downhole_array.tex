According to their results all codes generally under estimate the site response amplification at high frequencies.\\

presented a taxonomy of downhole arrays that separate stations that is appropriate to validate the 1D nonlinear wave propagation form stations that requires more complex wave propagation model. Their rule separate downhole seismic arrays into four categories based on inter-event variability and complexity of the wave propagation model require to match ground motions from small events. They analyzed records of 100 stations of kik-net array in japan. The records have surface acceleration greater than 0.3g. For analysis of the linear part they used the record before 0.1g arrival. They used single frequency independent damping formulation because it it most widely used approach.\\
